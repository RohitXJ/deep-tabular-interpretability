### Agent Instructions
Act like a `dev` and solve the problems listed here or entered by the user, make changes in the code files, do not try to make any changes in the notebook files
For this operation you will be needing to read codes from these two files,@ANN_architecture.py and @SHAP_for_ANNs.py so try not to change anthing here, and most importatly do you work of integrating this DL models in such a way that the existing and working ML models codes shouldnt be disturbed, i reperat , the ML models works shouldnt be hampered, make seprate files for DL part.

### Probelems to solve
* This project had all ML models, but now i wanna add some DL models too in here, so heres how this is gonna be : 
  * Atfirst take care of the option selections, put a separate category atfirst as ML or DL , if ML then the exisitng options will be there as usual , and if DL then for classification 2 model and for regression 2 models (the names will be like Shallow ANN and Deep ANN), also put a parameter choice during model selection that is Epochs, it will only be available if someone chooses DL else not, the range will be from 10-100 epochs, show it like 10,20,30...100. in list to choose
  * DL models need tensors right, so we need a small and separate block of data pre processing right, put a separate block of data processing that will come in work after the whole existing data pre processing unit finishes and returned the clean data, it will go through this new functions of ours where it will be getting converted to tensors, to find this structure check @ANN_architecture.py (use PyTorch)
  * Next it's time to integrate the DL models like ML models, make separate file for DL models and all, like so theres for ML ones, you will get the idea of what models, and how the architecture gonna be in this file @ANN_architecture.py, i guess you can figure it out very well there
  * After putting the models, add the training codes where the models will get trained based on the number of epochs chosen by the user at first stage of model selection., try to show the live training logs like after each 10 epochs the loss, then so on , show it in the model results section.
  * Now the Second most crucial part, the model evalutaions, do the necessary evolutions of the models and show the result as it is for the ML. DO it just like it is for ML, no extra thing that will hamper even the ML part.
  * Now the Most Crucial part, showing the interpretations, you can check that how the ML model's interpreatations are being displayed on the last page of the website, the same thing we gotta do with out DL models, but since these are different models we gotta need different codes, so the codes for showing the SHAP interpretations are in this file @SHAP_for_ANNs.py , check this file and you will find the exact codes that will generate the required graphs or plots, display those with proper explanable messages on how an user should understand what those plot mean to say, do not try to change anything in here, all the specific codes per models are given here , try to put the same things there, and yes one more thing that make a separate HTML page for showing this DL model's interpretations so it wont hamper the ML ones, update this in the flask too.
