# Task
Hi, here are your tasks, complete order wise. You will be assigned folders or files to scan, look at a code file once and then write about it to the destination file, and then scan another and append the new info, do not update old info written already, below find what to write and how, and try to write less as much as possible, just the main logic should be written.

* 1 Scan the code files of app/ and write about it in @APP.md
* 2 Scan the code files of data_process/ and write about it in @DATA_PROCESS.md
* 3 Scan the code files of model_hub/ and write about it in @MODEL_HUB.md
* 4 Scan the file run.py and write about it in @INFO.md


## WHAT TO WRITE FOR EACH FILE

For every file you scan, append a clearly separated section in this format, and try to write with as less words or lines possible, just clear intension of the file or codes:

### [APPEND | <DATE> | <FILE_PATH>]

- What this file does
- What logic is implemented
- What algorithms or techniques are used
- What inputs it takes
- What outputs it produces
- How it connects to other files

Write in clear technical detail.
